- 👋 Hi, I’m @arch0one
- 👀 I’m interested in things that I happen to find interesting.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning a lot of things, but fewer things than I once needed to learn.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on absolutely nothing, I do things by myself.
- 📫 How to reach me? Please, do not. If you must; arch0one@proton.me
- 😄 Pronouns: Whatever you use to describe a man in the language being spoken.
- ⚡ Fun fact: I believe the three most overrated things in life are: Parties, smiling, and fireworks. I also happen to be the world's greatest philosopher.
